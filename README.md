# Lorenz System Visualizer 

A dynamic and interactive visualization of the **Lorenz System**, a set of differential equations that model chaotic systems and form the foundation of chaos theory. This project demonstrates how tiny changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes‚Äîa hallmark of the famous **butterfly effect**. ü¶ã

## Features

- **Real-Time Rendering:** Visualize the Lorenz attractor as it evolves over time.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust key parameters like sigma (œÉ), rho (œÅ), and beta (Œ≤).
- **Interactive Zoom & Pan:** Drag and zoom to focus on specific parts of the attractor.
- **Fade and Line Effects:** Customize opacity, pulsation, and whether to display points or continuous lines.
- **Responsive Design:** The canvas dynamically resizes to fit your screen, keeping the center of the attractor in view.
